--- MKVToolNix Wrapper ---
==========================

------ Introduction ------
This program is a wrapper for mkvmerge.exe which ships as part of MKVToolNix (collection of tools for .mkv files).
This programs purpose is to facilitate the quick bulk editing of .MKV files, allowing you to edit audio, video and subtitle tracks.
Editing includes removal of tracks, defaulting tracks, forcing tracks, renaming tracks and setting track language.
It also accounts for scenarios where files have differing track setups, the analyse button flags offending files so they can be dealt with in isolation.

-- Installing MKV Merge --
The easiest way to get mkvmerge.exe is to download and install mkvtoolnix which you can find here: https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html#windows

----- Best Practices -----
Be consistent with naming! Here are some examples of practices to follow:
e.g. 
	Subtitle naming: 'English Full'
	Video naming:	Removing video name if it's just being used for branding as it serves no purpose, media players will just call it Track 1
	Video langauge:	'und'
	Audio naming:	'Japanese E-AC-3' with E-AC-3 being the codec used for the audio

Only set the forced flag for subtitles! It makes sense to set this flag on english subtitles if the audio track is Japanese and you are are an english speaker.
Advised to also set the default flag on the best suited sub title track, in most cases this will be the same track as the forced track.
Also a good idea to default both the audio and video track

------ Instructions ------
1) Click 'Browse' and select the folder that contains your .mkv files (This can be at season level: "~\Attack On Titan (2013)\Season 1" or show level "~\Attack On Titan (2013)")
2) You will now see on the left panel a list of all the .mkv files it has found, double check this list contains the files you expect, you also have the opportunity to not include certain files, you can do this by unchecking them
3) When happy with your selection click the 'Analyse' button (This will use your first file as a comparison point and compare it against all other files in the directory you selected, it checks to ensure subtitle names, audio tracks,.. match)
	To see progress look at the 'Output:' at the bottom of the window
4) On completion of a successful analysis the 'Start Batch' button will now be enabled and the tracks table will be populated
	Now customise the track settings to your liking, keep in mind you can rename tracks and languages! (See FAQ below for explanations on what each column does)
5) click 'Start Batch' and watch the 'Output:' text to see the progress, upon completion you will find the outputted files in the 'MasteredFiles' folder (Located in same directory as your .mkv files)
Your done, open your outputted files in your favourite media player to confirm they are as you expected!

---------- FAQ ----------
Q) During analysis one or more of my files had a 'FAIL' so I am unable to click 'Start Batch', help!
A) A file fails when there are differences in track count, track naming, track language and or track ordering when compared to the first file it analysed
	(Audio, Video and Subtitle each having their own set of tracks e.g. 'English Subs' is it's own subtitle track)
	FAILs can happen when authors of these files use a variety of sources to make up a season or just aren't very consistent with their settings
	To progress all you have to do is deselect the files that have the 'FAIL' status, you can see which have failed by reviewing the 'Output:' section / red highlighting.
	Once you have done this click 'Analyse' again, if all is well you should now have PASSES unlocking the 'Start Batch' button the track view panel.

Q) What do the colours in the file list mean?
A) Red = The file failed it's analysis | Dark Red = An error occured while writing the file during the batch process | Green = File successfully written as part of batch | Orange = File writing is in progress as part of batch

Q) What does the 'Including' column mean in the Tracks table?
A) If it is ticked it will be included as part of the outputted files, if it is unchecked the given track will be removed
	E.g. Deselecting the 'English' Audio will result in the outputted file no longer having a English audio track

Q) What does the 'Id' column mean in the Tracks table?
A) the track ID is a unique identifier assigned to each track within the container. A track refers to a specific type of data within the MKV file, such as video, audio, subtitles, or attachments.
	The track ID allows the media player or decoder to correctly identify and play each track. (You cannot edit this id in this tool)

Q) What does the 'Name' column mean in the Tracks table?
A) This is simply the display name for the given track that is shown in your media player when selecting subtitle tracks / audio tracks / video tracks e.g. 'English Signs & Songs'
	This field is also optional meaning you can delete the text and then your media player will simply reference your track via it's ID e.g. Track 1, Track 2,...

Q) What does the 'Language' column mean in the Tracks table?
A) Each track can be assigned a ISO 639-2 language code e.g. jpn,eng,... that identifies the language of the content in that track.
	This language code can help media players and other software to select and display the appropriate language for the user, such as for subtitles or audio tracks. You may edit this field!

Q) What does the 'Type' column mean in the Tracks table?
A) Each track can be assigned a track type that identifies the type of content in that track. This information is used by media players and other software to identify how to play and display the content in the track.
	e.g. Video track, Audio track, Subtitle track

Q) What does the 'Codec' column mean in the Tracks table?
A) Displays the type of codec used for the given track e.g. subtitle track could have a codec of type 'S_TEXT/ASS'
	This info is purely there to provide you with more information to more easily distinguish between the tracks

Q) What does the 'Default Flag' column mean in the Tracks table?
A) Each track can have a default flag that indicates whether that track should be used as the default track when playing the file.
	The default track is the track that is selected by default when the MKV file is played, without the user needing to manually choose it given they have subtitles turned on globally for the player.
	e.g. if you set the 'English Subs' track as default your media player will automatically select this track
	Note: Not all media players respect this flag

Q) What does the 'Forced Flag' column mean in the Tracks table?
A) The "forced flag" is a metadata attribute that can be assigned to certain subtitle tracks to indicate that the subtitles in that track should always be displayed, even if the user has turned off subtitles.
	It is typically used for subtitles that are essential to the understanding of the content.
	Note: Not all media players respect this flag and this flag is only applicable to Subtitle tracks!
