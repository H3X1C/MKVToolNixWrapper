# MKVToolNixWrapper

## Introduction
This program is a wrapper for mkvmerge.exe which ships as part of MKVToolNix (collection of tools for the Matroska media container format (.MKV)).
It's purpose is to be able to quickly batch edit multiple MKV files at once (rename, remove, set default / forced flags for tracks within each MKV file)

## Use case
You have a series of anime that has it's default audio track as English, the show also has a Japanese audio track and multiple subtitle tracks for various languages but sadly your desired subtitle track isn't default.
Using MKVToolNix Wrapper you can quickly remove the tracks you don't want such as English audio track, French subtitles and also default the tracks you want such as English subtitles.
End result is reduced file size and the convenience of opening the file in your chosen player and it automatically defaulting to your own personal preference of subtitles and audio.
